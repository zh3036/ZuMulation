[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to allocating money to projects being built for a community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to allocating money to projects being built for a community of hackers are Project 1 - Sustainable Food Production System (allocation: $30)
Explanation: As an aspiring chef with a culinary education, I am passionate about turning locally-grown and sustainably sourced ingredients into delicious culinary creations. I believe this project could provide valuable resources and inspire community residents, including myself, in innovative and sustainable cooking practices while also reducing our carbon footprint., Project 2 - Skill-Sharing and Educational Initiatives (allocation: $25)
Explanation: We can never stop learning, improving and sharing our knowledge with others. Combining culinary education and experience with others' skill sets will only lead to a more vibrant and multifaceted community. I look forward to expanding my own horizons as well as having the opportunity to teach cooking classes and share my passion for food with my fellow community members., Project 3 - Transportation and Mobility Promoting (allocation: $20)
Explanation: Being an advocate for healthy living and sustainability, ensuring efficient and environment-friendly mobility options is important. Commuting to local farmers' markets and other food sourcing without negatively impacting the environment is both practical and appealing for me. Investing in bike-shares and community-friendly pathways will also encourage a more active lifestyle and foster community-wide connections., Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program (allocation: $15)
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community., Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment (allocation: $10)
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living..

Here is the list of people and things they said:
['Citizen 1: Mary Green\nPersona: Environmental enthusiast, age 32, single, yoga instructor\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Excited about the idea of living in an ecologically focused environment promoting a strong, healthy sense of community.\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly interested in health and wellness, renewable energy, and ecosystem conservations. Appreciates access to shared resources, creative culture, and sustainable transportation methods.', 'Citizen 2: Tom Sanders\nPersona: Entrepreneur, age 40, married, two kids, involved in the tech industry\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Sees it as a smart way of living, intrigued by innovation and creative opportunities offered in such a space.\nAttitudes towards projects: Looks forward to collaborative workspaces, skill-sharing opportunities, and sustainable solutions in energy and food production.

Wants to explore the world of art and culture for stress-relieving purposes.', 'Citizen 5: Angela Jenkins\nPersona: Single mom, age 35, raising two children alone, works from home as a marketing specialist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: A potentially secure and supportive environment for her children to grow up and learn the importance of valuable community interaction.\nAttitudes towards projects: Primarily focused on the health and wellness program, the educational initatives, and the transportation & mobility promoting projects, as well as supportive and inclusive spaces like the resource library and the collaborative work zones.', 'Citizen 6: Louisa Hernandez\nPersona: Aspiring chef, age 25, just completed culinary education, co-living native since college\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Planning to adopt an all-practical, cutting-edge model for healthy, sustainable lifestyles\nAttitudes towards projects: Extremely open to options that welcome her to innovate, actively participate, and contribute in new ways. Zones involving food production and transportation resonate, as well as the poised skill-sharing initiatives and health promotion activities at large.', 'Citizen 7: Samuel Wilson\nPersona: Architect, age 46, separated, devoted father and amateur cyclist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Heâ€™s hungry to join projects driving improvement in healthier urban landscape design, as it aligns with his worldview and principles.\nAttitudes towards this matter are expressed through his deep interest to contribute to solid renewable energy schemes, enhancing transportation, promoting ecosystem conservation-centric activities, and securing enough Rec and Tech facilities triggering creative development amongst dwellers in these spaces.']

Criteria for allocating funds to projects:

- Target impact: How many people will the project benefit? Projects benefiting more residents should receive higher funding.  

- Project necessity: How essential or needed is the project for the community? More necessary projects should get more funding.

- Cost effectiveness: How much funding is required relative to the impact or benefits? Lower cost per person impacted weighs in favor of more funding.  

- Feasibility: Is the project clearly defined and likely to be successfully implemented? More feasible projects deserve more funding.

- Alignment with community interests: Does the project align with the interests and needs expressed by the residents? Greater alignment weighs in favor of more funding. 

- Promotion of health and wellness: Does the project promote the health, fitness or wellbeing of residents? Such projects should receive more funding.

- Environmental sustainability: Does the project promote environmental sustainability goals of the community? More sustainable projects deserve higher funding.

- Skill building and education: Does the project provide skills training or educational opportunities? Such projects should receive more funding.
Human: Can you simplify the above to a list of simple criteria only. If any criteria are similar, merge them into one. Each criteria should be no more than 4 words?
Your response should be a list of comma separated values, eg: `foo, bar, baz`
