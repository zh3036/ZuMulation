## application on funding allocation: QF copilot

Use LLM to help communities conduct Quadratic Funding more effectively.
1. Each member creates a voter profile: expressing their general thoughts on the desired projects to be built, expectations for the community, and evaluations of previous projects using natural language.
2. LLM generates a set of criteria based on the ideas of all members, and for each criteria LLM tries to scoring each project on behalf of every member of the community.
3. LLM tries to conduct quadratic voting on behalf of each member for a group of projects based on these criteria scores (with a budget of 100 USD).
4. A funding allocation is generated from the quadratic voting process.
5. LLM simulates being each member, provides feedback on the funding allocation, and decides whether to modify their vote.
6. Recalculate the funding allocation based on the modified votes.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the funding allocation doesn't change significantly, at which point we consider it to have reached a dynamic equilibrium(or a fix point). This LLM-generated funding allocation can serve as a reference for the actual allocation.
8. If new projects come up later, the APP can predict whether the community members are likely to be willing to fund them. Each member can inspect the vote/criteria score generated by LLM on their behalf and provide feedback to update their voter profile.
