Idea pitch
Self-issued SBT
description : You issue your self an SBT with a claim and let others endorse the SBT to give it credibility. 

why it is useful: 

1  record off line events , “I clean the house for residents” SBT recognized by residents. “we do gardening together” recognized by fellow gardeners , “I made good arguments” rec by people who attend same offline discussions , “thoughtful ZK hacker” rec by ZK devs with 1000 github stars.   recording is useful as it is the basis of narrating history, the credibility of recognition should be computed according to something like eigen-trust algorithm. 

2 give social relation semantics, you may want to know how your friends and second or higher degree connections at zuzalu  interact with each other , so that you can better navigate zuzalu social networks. For example, you are a coffee lover and you saw Sam has SBT “do barista coffee together” recognized by your friend K, then you know you can go talk to Sam about coffee. We could even use NLP to get a coffee subgraph from the whole social graph. 

skill: solidity , full stack, idea generation, 

I am on a visitor pass , but i have friends who are currently residents.



Dominant Assurance Contracts:
Build a smart contract and straightforward front end for DACS.
There are 2 principles of DACS...
1. There is a target funding threshhold and deadline. If it is mett, a
transaction occurs. If it is not, then everyone is refunded.
2. Early funders are incentivized with additional reward.
For example, if we had a 1 yr target of 100k to purchase a beachsiide
apartment in prospera honduras, then if you funded the first 1Ok
within the first month you receive a guaranteed 5% return on yobur
funds.
If 100k is raised, the apartment building is purchased at the
deadline.
If 100k is not reached by the deadline, everyone is refunded.
We need a smart contract developer, a front end developer, arhd
people interested in crowdfunding and incentive design

Project idea: a blockchain-based tool for curating and preserving
valuable discussions on Discord and Telegram. The tool would use a
bot to quickly store selected content and associated metadata
(author, time, channel, tags) on the chain. This content could then
be minted as an nft. Community members could easily retrieve the
content through different tags.
The goal of the bot is to help keep interesting discussions alive aand
visible across different time zones and platforms. We welcome
developers and content creators, or anyone who has any idea to
join our team and help build this open source tool!
why we need this tool:
- A lot of community members are feeling overwhelmed with the
amount of messages on Telegram. While it's important to keep the
discussions and natural correspondence going, we can save the
more important information (eg. schedules, events, etc) from the
chatbox to the chain.
Zuzalu needs to keep discussions alive online as all residences and
visitors go elsewhere after May. This bot can help to curate and
preserve interesting discussions and topics, making them more
accessible to the community, especially those in different time
zones, and prepare for the next Zuzalu event.

The problem we aim to solve is how to bring people togetheer in
safe and enjoyable way. Current methods of inviting people to
events lack accountability and can lead to situations where people
may feel unsafe or uncomfortable.
1533 aims to create a safer and more accountable way to connect
with people. We will use NFTs, ZK tech, Zuzalu passport,
decentralized storage and a Bolivar (Venezuelan Note) with an
unique serial number to bootstrap the community.
The idea is to create a more trustworthy social graph that can be
used to build stronger connections among peers.
Our hope is that 1533 will become a valuable tool for communities
like Zuzalu, and eventually for anyone looking for a safer and more
accountable way to connect with others.
We are looking for other creators (engineers, designers, artists). I'm
sure that many people in Zuzalu have a piece of the puzzle that is
necessary for making this a reality.

1 Short description of the idea
Title: Zuzalu TimeMap (White Paper Equivalent)
One important component of Zuzalu is Zupass, which allowsus to
connect to the future! We allow Zupass holders to publicly share
their approximate coordinates once every month (e.g. accurateto
10km, consider privacy). While this feature may seem insignificant at
first glance, Zuzalu's development timeline can easily be visualized
in map form. The development timeline can show how the platform
grows over time and highlight areas where user activity is frequent.
Users will be able to view the map and learn about the development
of Zuzalu.As more and more users use Zupass functionality and
share their locations, the Zuzalu map will become a valuable
resource. This can be used to guide the future developmentof
Zuzalu.
It may look like a covid map...
2 Skills needed to build the project:
single-page application > solidity > zk
3 How many team members are you looking for?
Not sure, because may join other people's teams

I'm interested in doing a community value accountability dashboaard
scored by zk attestations.
We build a dashboard showing a list of community values, and fo1
each value a score to represent how much (or little) the communiity
in aggregate has lived up to those values.
The scores are derived from attestations from a zupass holder to
another zupass holder or the whole community about one or moTre
values and can be a
. Ideally most of it is secret, only the
aggregate score is public to prevent gaming and popularity contests.
(I'm a full stack web developer with some limited experience in
solidity and zk tooling)

just got an idea for network state after the pitch time:
build some assets class that can only be owned by two people ,
something like common properties. for example a proof of
marriage NFT can only be owned together by two people. Or some
erc20 token that can only be owned together by two people. This
would serve as a bond between two citizens of a network sstate. if
they want to use the token, they have to both agree. If they want to
transfer the token, they have to transfer it to another pair of peopleلا
The difference between this and a multisig wallet is that : if one
person want to quit having common assets with other other one,
then these assets disappears.
in order to prevent one people have two wallet, so some kind of
POH is needed, zupass would do as well.
i got another hackathon project already, so won't be able tto work on
this idea, but if anyone is interested , i am happy to talk and
contribute some design thoughts.

PROPOSAL: Coordination app that allows members of Zuazlu to find
each other across the world to work, live and travel together.
FEATURES:
- real time location tracking on a world map interface for
spontaneous meet-ups (kinda like the snapchat feature)
coordination tool where members can indicate to which locatijons
they will go next with which probability to enable coordination on
location planning
- ZK-passport gating for exclusive access to verified Zuzalu members
WHO WE NEED: Someone with ZK coding experience that canhelp
us create the verification mechanism for the app
We'll create a channel for this on the building hub - please reach out
if you're interested

Hi! We're building Whispers:
A TG tool for Zuzalians to anonymously send "whisper tokens" to
each other.
How it works: A can anonymously send a whisper token to B. This
token could contain a sentiment like "dope vibe". If B appreciates
this anonymous compliment, they can claim it and share on the
wider tg channel. Every zuzalian will be able to view this whisper
token, casting their approval or disapproval via a thumbs-up or
down.
The initial thought was to provide an engaging space for shy peoplle
to connect with people they vibe with. But data gathered from these
interaction can be consolidated into a community social dashboard,
showing how vibrant this community is underlined and maybe
provide some insight of the sentiments expressed towards
zuzalians.
potentially I'm looking for someone with zk experience and a UI
designer

After attending AlxCrypto this past weekend I got
doomer pilled.
I thought about an idea to implement as las resort in case AGI takes
over: a distributed dead-man switch to unplug key Al infra.
I know it's super naive, but I didn't find anything similar on the
internet and we can always trust on having outsider innovation by
not being constrained by current paradigms. 9/10 won't make
sense, but experimentation is key to explore new posibilities.
Anyone with good system designs and infraestructure in generalaare
welcomed to jam on this! DMs open

Two ZK ideas for anyone to run with:
1. zk-risk - for more sophisticated DeFi and trading systems, we
need a better understanding of risk metrics on chain. The systeem
should be able to take as input any arbitrary combination of asssets
or "positions", including pure ETH, DeFi lending positions, other
complicated products such as options or vault derivatives. As well it
should take any market data it needs from onchain sources soas
not to be reliant on offchain systems. It should output the classsic
risk metrics of Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, etc), implied volatility,
and the results of a monte-Carlo simulation of portfolio shocks. Thiss
should be zk in order to both keep the input addresses privatebut
also to offload complex computations that are not efficient in EVM.
A prototype of this could simply calculate the Greeks andIV for a
given asset.
2. zkmI-LLM marketplace. Using a zkml library, enable creaators of
LLM models to rent access to their library or buy their model
without anyone being able to view the model code/weights directly.
Kind of an NFT DRM system for large models.
Bonus: Zupass has inspired some thinking around Network Stateفي
tooling, however the thoughts are incomplete/not ready to express
for a hack. If this has deeply inspired you as well I'm happy to jaam on
this.
