[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1 - Sustainable Food Production System (allocation: $30)
Explanation: As an aspiring chef with a culinary education, I am passionate about turning locally-grown and sustainably sourced ingredients into delicious culinary creations. I believe this project could provide valuable resources and inspire community residents, including myself, in innovative and sustainable cooking practices while also reducing our carbon footprint., Project 2 - Skill-Sharing and Educational Initiatives (allocation: $25)
Explanation: We can never stop learning, improving and sharing our knowledge with others. Combining culinary education and experience with others' skill sets will only lead to a more vibrant and multifaceted community. I look forward to expanding my own horizons as well as having the opportunity to teach cooking classes and share my passion for food with my fellow community members., Project 3 - Transportation and Mobility Promoting (allocation: $20)
Explanation: Being an advocate for healthy living and sustainability, ensuring efficient and environment-friendly mobility options is important. Commuting to local farmers' markets and other food sourcing without negatively impacting the environment is both practical and appealing for me. Investing in bike-shares and community-friendly pathways will also encourage a more active lifestyle and foster community-wide connections., Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program (allocation: $15)
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community., Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment (allocation: $10)
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living..

Here is the list of people and things they said:
['Citizen 1: Mary Green\nPersona: Environmental enthusiast, age 32, single, yoga instructor\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Excited about the idea of living in an ecologically focused environment promoting a strong, healthy sense of community.\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly interested in health and wellness, renewable energy, and ecosystem conservations.

Wants to explore the world of art and culture for stress-relieving purposes.', 'Citizen 5: Angela Jenkins\nPersona: Single mom, age 35, raising two children alone, works from home as a marketing specialist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: A potentially secure and supportive environment for her children to grow up and learn the importance of valuable community interaction.\nAttitudes towards projects: Primarily focused on the health and wellness program, the educational initatives, and the transportation & mobility promoting projects, as well as supportive and inclusive spaces like the resource library and the collaborative work zones.', 'Citizen 6: Louisa Hernandez\nPersona: Aspiring chef, age 25, just completed culinary education, co-living native since college\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Planning to adopt an all-practical, cutting-edge model for healthy, sustainable lifestyles\nAttitudes towards projects: Extremely open to options that welcome her to innovate, actively participate, and contribute in new ways. Zones involving food production and transportation resonate, as well as the poised skill-sharing initiatives and health promotion activities at large.', 'Citizen 7: Samuel Wilson\nPersona: Architect, age 46, separated, devoted father and amateur cyclist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Heâ€™s hungry to join projects driving improvement in healthier urban landscape design, as it aligns with his worldview and principles.\nAttitudes towards this matter are expressed through his deep interest to contribute to solid renewable energy schemes, enhancing transportation, promoting ecosystem conservation-centric activities, and securing enough Rec and Tech facilities triggering creative development amongst dwellers in these spaces.']

[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1 - Sustainable Food Production System 
Explanation: As an aspiring chef with a culinary education, I am passionate about turning locally-grown and sustainably sourced ingredients into delicious culinary creations. I believe this project could provide valuable resources and inspire community residents, including myself, in innovative and sustainable cooking practices while also reducing our carbon footprint., Project 2 - Skill-Sharing and Educational Initiatives 
Explanation: We can never stop learning, improving and sharing our knowledge with others. Combining culinary education and experience with others' skill sets will only lead to a more vibrant and multifaceted community. I look forward to expanding my own horizons as well as having the opportunity to teach cooking classes and share my passion for food with my fellow community members., Project 3 - Transportation and Mobility Promoting 
Explanation: Being an advocate for healthy living and sustainability, ensuring efficient and environment-friendly mobility options is important. Commuting to local farmers' markets and other food sourcing without negatively impacting the environment is both practical and appealing for me. Investing in bike-shares and community-friendly pathways will also encourage a more active lifestyle and foster community-wide connections., Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program 
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community., Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment 
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living..

Here is the list of people and things they said:
['Citizen 1: Mary Green\nPersona: Environmental enthusiast, age 32, single, yoga instructor\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Excited about the idea of living in an ecologically focused environment promoting a strong, healthy sense of community.\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly interested in health and wellness, renewable energy, and ecosystem conservations. Appreciates access to shared resources, creative culture, and sustainable transportation methods.', 'Citizen 2: Tom Sanders\nPersona: Entrepreneur, age 40, married, two kids, involved in the tech industry\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Sees it as a smart way of living, intrigued by innovation and creative opportunities offered in such a space.\nAttitudes towards projects: Looks forward to collaborative workspaces, skill-sharing opportunities, and sustainable solutions in energy and food production. Appreciates health and wellness initiatives to achieve a better work-life balance.', 'Citizen 3: Rachel Thompson\nPersona: Artist, age 29, in a relationship, mural artist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Loves the idea of a creative and culturally thriving space with exciting opportunities for artists and creators.\nAttitudes towards projects: Enthusiastic about art and culture projects, community garden programs, and anything related to enhancing creativity. Appreciates the community-based actions leading to the environmental stewardship of multiple projects.', 'Citizen 4: Carlos Diaz\nPersona: Environmental engineer, age 37, married, interested in STEM subjects\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Extensively fascinated by the potential to contribute expertise to develop more sustainable living spaces\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly keen on projects involving renewable energy infrastructure, waste management solutions, and technology-driven skill-sharing workshops. Wants to explore the world of art and culture for stress-relieving purposes.', 'Citizen 5: Angela Jenkins\nPersona: Single mom, age 35, raising two children alone, works from home as a marketing specialist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: A potentially secure and supportive environment for her children to grow up and learn the importance of valuable community interaction.\nAttitudes towards projects: Primarily focused on the health and wellness program, the educational initatives, and the transportation & mobility promoting projects, as well as supportive and inclusive spaces like the resource library and the collaborative work zones.', 'Citizen 6: Louisa Hernandez\nPersona: Aspiring chef, age 25, just completed culinary education, co-living native since college\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Planning to adopt an all-practical, cutting-edge model for healthy, sustainable lifestyles\nAttitudes towards projects: Extremely open to options that welcome her to innovate, actively participate, and contribute in new ways. Zones involving food production and transportation resonate, as well as the poised skill-sharing initiatives and health promotion activities at large.', 'Citizen 7: Samuel Wilson\nPersona: Architect, age 46, separated, devoted father and amateur cyclist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Heâ€™s hungry to join projects driving improvement in healthier urban landscape design, as it aligns with his worldview and principles.\nAttitudes towards this matter are expressed through his deep interest to contribute to solid renewable energy schemes, enhancing transportation, promoting ecosystem conservation-centric activities, and securing enough Rec and Tech facilities triggering creative development amongst dwellers in these spaces.']

[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1 - Sustainable Food Production System 
Explanation: As an aspiring chef with a culinary education, I am passionate about turning locally-grown and sustainably sourced ingredients into delicious culinary creations. I believe this project could provide valuable resources and inspire community residents, including myself, in innovative and sustainable cooking practices while also reducing our carbon footprint., Project 2 - Skill-Sharing and Educational Initiatives 
Explanation: We can never stop learning, improving and sharing our knowledge with others. Combining culinary education and experience with others' skill sets will only lead to a more vibrant and multifaceted community. I look forward to expanding my own horizons as well as having the opportunity to teach cooking classes and share my passion for food with my fellow community members., Project 3 - Transportation and Mobility Promoting 
Explanation: Being an advocate for healthy living and sustainability, ensuring efficient and environment-friendly mobility options is important. Commuting to local farmers' markets and other food sourcing without negatively impacting the environment is both practical and appealing for me. Investing in bike-shares and community-friendly pathways will also encourage a more active lifestyle and foster community-wide connections., Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program 
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community., Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment 
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living..

Here is the list of people and things they said:
['Citizen 1: Mary Green\nPersona: Environmental enthusiast, age 32, single, yoga instructor\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Excited about the idea of living in an ecologically focused environment promoting a strong, healthy sense of community.\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly interested in health and wellness, renewable energy, and ecosystem conservations. Appreciates access to shared resources, creative culture, and sustainable transportation methods.', 'Citizen 2: Tom Sanders\nPersona: Entrepreneur, age 40, married, two kids, involved in the tech industry\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Sees it as a smart way of living, intrigued by innovation and creative opportunities offered in such a space.\nAttitudes towards projects: Looks forward to collaborative workspaces, skill-sharing opportunities, and sustainable solutions in energy and food production. Appreciates health and wellness initiatives to achieve a better work-life balance.', 'Citizen 3: Rachel Thompson\nPersona: Artist, age 29, in a relationship, mural artist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Loves the idea of a creative and culturally thriving space with exciting opportunities for artists and creators.\nAttitudes towards projects: Enthusiastic about art and culture projects, community garden programs, and anything related to enhancing creativity. Appreciates the community-based actions leading to the environmental stewardship of multiple projects.', 'Citizen 4: Carlos Diaz\nPersona: Environmental engineer, age 37, married, interested in STEM subjects\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Extensively fascinated by the potential to contribute expertise to develop more sustainable living spaces\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly keen on projects involving renewable energy infrastructure, waste management solutions, and technology-driven skill-sharing workshops. Wants to explore the world of art and culture for stress-relieving purposes.', 'Citizen 5: Angela Jenkins\nPersona: Single mom, age 35, raising two children alone, works from home as a marketing specialist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: A potentially secure and supportive environment for her children to grow up and learn the importance of valuable community interaction.\nAttitudes towards projects: Primarily focused on the health and wellness program, the educational initatives, and the transportation & mobility promoting projects, as well as supportive and inclusive spaces like the resource library and the collaborative work zones.', 'Citizen 6: Louisa Hernandez\nPersona: Aspiring chef, age 25, just completed culinary education, co-living native since college\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Planning to adopt an all-practical, cutting-edge model for healthy, sustainable lifestyles\nAttitudes towards projects: Extremely open to options that welcome her to innovate, actively participate, and contribute in new ways. Zones involving food production and transportation resonate, as well as the poised skill-sharing initiatives and health promotion activities at large.', 'Citizen 7: Samuel Wilson\nPersona: Architect, age 46, separated, devoted father and amateur cyclist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Heâ€™s hungry to join projects driving improvement in healthier urban landscape design, as it aligns with his worldview and principles.\nAttitudes towards this matter are expressed through his deep interest to contribute to solid renewable energy schemes, enhancing transportation, promoting ecosystem conservation-centric activities, and securing enough Rec and Tech facilities triggering creative development amongst dwellers in these spaces.']

[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1 - Sustainable Food Production System 
Explanation: As an aspiring chef with a culinary education, I am passionate about turning locally-grown and sustainably sourced ingredients into delicious culinary creations. I believe this project could provide valuable resources and inspire community residents, including myself, in innovative and sustainable cooking practices while also reducing our carbon footprint., Project 2 - Skill-Sharing and Educational Initiatives 
Explanation: We can never stop learning, improving and sharing our knowledge with others. Combining culinary education and experience with others' skill sets will only lead to a more vibrant and multifaceted community. I look forward to expanding my own horizons as well as having the opportunity to teach cooking classes and share my passion for food with my fellow community members., Project 3 - Transportation and Mobility Promoting 
Explanation: Being an advocate for healthy living and sustainability, ensuring efficient and environment-friendly mobility options is important. Commuting to local farmers' markets and other food sourcing without negatively impacting the environment is both practical and appealing for me. Investing in bike-shares and community-friendly pathways will also encourage a more active lifestyle and foster community-wide connections., Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program 
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community., Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment 
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living..

Here is the list of people and things they said:
['Citizen 1: Mary Green\nPersona: Environmental enthusiast, age 32, single, yoga instructor\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Excited about the idea of living in an ecologically focused environment promoting a strong, healthy sense of community.\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly interested in health and wellness, renewable energy, and ecosystem conservations.

Appreciates health and wellness initiatives to achieve a better work-life balance.', 'Citizen 3: Rachel Thompson\nPersona: Artist, age 29, in a relationship, mural artist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Loves the idea of a creative and culturally thriving space with exciting opportunities for artists and creators.\nAttitudes towards projects: Enthusiastic about art and culture projects, community garden programs, and anything related to enhancing creativity. Appreciates the community-based actions leading to the environmental stewardship of multiple projects.', 'Citizen 4: Carlos Diaz\nPersona: Environmental engineer, age 37, married, interested in STEM subjects\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Extensively fascinated by the potential to contribute expertise to develop more sustainable living spaces\nAttitudes towards projects: Highly keen on projects involving renewable energy infrastructure, waste management solutions, and technology-driven skill-sharing workshops. Wants to explore the world of art and culture for stress-relieving purposes.', 'Citizen 5: Angela Jenkins\nPersona: Single mom, age 35, raising two children alone, works from home as a marketing specialist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: A potentially secure and supportive environment for her children to grow up and learn the importance of valuable community interaction.\nAttitudes towards projects: Primarily focused on the health and wellness program, the educational initatives, and the transportation & mobility promoting projects, as well as supportive and inclusive spaces like the resource library and the collaborative work zones.', 'Citizen 6: Louisa Hernandez\nPersona: Aspiring chef, age 25, just completed culinary education, co-living native since college\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Planning to adopt an all-practical, cutting-edge model for healthy, sustainable lifestyles\nAttitudes towards projects: Extremely open to options that welcome her to innovate, actively participate, and contribute in new ways. Zones involving food production and transportation resonate, as well as the poised skill-sharing initiatives and health promotion activities at large.', 'Citizen 7: Samuel Wilson\nPersona: Architect, age 46, separated, devoted father and amateur cyclist\nGeneral Opinion on Zuzalu: Heâ€™s hungry to join projects driving improvement in healthier urban landscape design, as it aligns with his worldview and principles.\nAttitudes towards this matter are expressed through his deep interest to contribute to solid renewable energy schemes, enhancing transportation, promoting ecosystem conservation-centric activities, and securing enough Rec and Tech facilities triggering creative development amongst dwellers in these spaces.']

AI: Based on the descriptions provided, I have created a list of criteria that could help in using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers:

1. Environmental sustainability: Projects should focus on reducing the community's carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly practices.

2. Health and wellness: Initiatives aimed at improving physical and mental health, such as yoga classes, meditation sessions, and holistic therapies.

3. Skill-sharing and education: Workshops or classes where community members can teach, learn, and collaborate, sharing their knowledge and expertise.

4. Food production and accessibility: Initiatives for local and sustainably sourced food options, promoting healthy eating habits and reducing waste.

5. Transportation and mobility: Solutions to provide efficient, environment-friendly mobility options for accessing resources within the community and beyond.

6. Renewable energy: Infrastructure and resources focused on implementing sustainable energy sources in the community.

7. Waste management: Solutions and systems aimed at reducing, reusing, and recycling waste generated by the community.

8. Art and culture enrichment: Projects to encourage artistic expression, creativity, and cultural activities, blending these elements into daily life.

9. Community garden programs: Initiatives to incorporate gardening and nature-focused activities, fostering a connection with the environment and promoting local food production.

10. Work-life balance: Projects aimed at promoting a healthy balance between work and personal time, especially for those with family obligations.

11. Inclusive spaces: Creating and maintaining shared spaces that cater to the diverse needs of community members, including resource libraries and collaborative work zones.

12. Ecosystem conservation: Investment in projects that protect and conserve the local ecosystem and wildlife, ensuring the conservation of the environment for future generations.

Based on these criteria, you can use quadratic funding to strategically allocate funds to projects that will be most beneficial to the community and adequately satisfy the interests of its members.
Human: Can you simplify the above to a list of simple criteria only. If any criteria are similar, merge them into one. Each criteria should be no more than 4 words?
Your response should be a list of comma separated values, eg: `foo, bar, baz`

Human: Given a potential action for the problem of using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers and a set of criteria related to the problem, can you assign a number between -1 and 1 for how positively this option each individual criteria? 1 meaning the criteria is very positively impacted, 0 meaning the criteria is not impacted, -1 meaning the criteria is very negatively impacted. Make sure to assign a value to each criteria, do not leave any out and write out the complete JSON.
The option: Project 4 - Health and Wellness Program 
Explanation: Total well-being comprises more than just eating right; a healthy mind and body are of vital importance too. Yoga, meditation, and holistic therapies resonate deeply with my desire to live a well-rounded life. This project could attract health professionals from whom I can learn and truly cultivate a wholesome atmosphere in our community.
The criteria: Environmental sustainability, Health & wellness, Skill-sharing education, Sustainable food production, Eco-friendly transportation, Renewable energy, Waste management, Arts & culture, Community gardening, Work-life balance, Inclusive spaces, Ecosystem conservation.Your response should be a JSON object with keys being the criteria and values being the number, eg: `{"foo": 0.1, "bar": 0.9, "baz": 0.6}`

The option: Project 5 - Art and Culture Enrichment 
Explanation: A healthy dose of art and culture can breathe life into any community. As an appreciator of art, I believe dedicated gallery spaces, workshops, and other creative projects will not only foster our home-grown artistic expressions but also incorporate creativity into our everyday lives, potentially blending with food production and healthy living.
