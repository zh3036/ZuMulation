## objections


1. funding Project 4, a proposed cigarette and alcohol shop, raises ethical concerns as it may promote unhealthy habits and substance abuse issues within the community. Selling these addictive and potentially harmful substances does not align with our goals of promoting health, sustainability and community wellbeing.  

2. The current funding allocation seems disproportionate for some impactful projects.Some projects with potentially greater social impact, like the Sustainable Food Production system and waste management program, have been allocated less funding compared to projects like Renewable Energy Infrastructure. A reevaluation of the funding criteria may be needed to better align allocations with desired social outcomes.

3. The funding for the Sustainable Food Project, focused on providing the community with locally sourced healthy produce, appears too low given its importance for our carbon footprint, health and self-sufficiency. Increased funding for this project is recommended above further expanding renewable energy or other initiatives.

## sample change opinions from citizen 1

$&$ [4,2 ,5 , 0, 3] $&$  

1. I fully agree that funding Project 4, the cigarette and alcohol shop, would go against our community's goals of health and sustainability. I do not support this project and have lowered my vote to 0.  

2. While renewable energy is important, I have increased my vote for the Sustainable Food Production project to 4 given its potential impact on health, self-sufficiency and carbon footprint. Access to local food grown sustainably should be a higher priority.  

3. I have increased my vote to 5 for the Waste Management and Recycling Program since reducing waste and promoting recycling and composting will be critical for the community's sustainability.  

4. My vote of 2 for the Renewable Energy Infrastructure project remains unchanged. While valuable, I see greater potential impact from food and waste sustainability initiatives at this time.
  
5. I have lowered my vote slightly for the Communal Resource Library to 3 given that sharing resources is secondary to basic needs like food and energy for me.
