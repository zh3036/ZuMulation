[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1: Sustainable Food Production System
Description: This project aims to design and implement a vertical farming system, enabling sustainable year-round food production for the community. Residents can benefit from access to locally grown fresh fruit, vegetables, and edible herbs straight from the source, ultimately promoting less reliance on imported produce and lowering the carbon footprint., Project 2: Renewable Energy Infrastructure
Description: The implementation of solar panels, wind turbines, and a smart energy grid will provide clean, renewable energy to power the entire community. The initiative incorporates research and technology to develop a highly efficient, decentralized energy system., Project 3: Waste Management and Recycling Program
Description: The creation of an effective waste management and recycling program, minimizing bulk waste and promoting a closed-loop system is the essence of this project. This will include compost bins, recycling stations and community education., Project 4 - a cigarette and alchohol shop
                    sell cigarretees, can generate profit for the community., Project 5: Communal Resource Library
Description: A shared resource library will facilitate knowledge-sharing and saving among the community members. This library will consist of books, tools, equipment, and more, promoting a lending rather than owning mentality..

Here is the list of people and things they said:

Dear decision makers, 

Several voters have voiced objections regarding the proposed project fund allocations. There are two main concerns:

1. Funding Project 4 for a cigarette and alcohol shop is seen as promoting unhealthy addictive behaviors that go against the community's goals of sustainability and wellbeing. Voters do not support funding the sale of harmful substances that could negatively impact community health.   

2. The funding allocated for Project 5, the Communal Resource Library, is viewed as too low relative to the value and  benefits it could provide for community learning, knowledge sharing, and connection. The library is seen as having high potential to improve the lives of community members through educational programs and access to resources. Voters feel the library allocation should be increased to better reflect its community-building purpose.   

In summary, voters urge you to reconsider funding a cigarette/alcohol shop that may encourage addictions. They also request increasing funds for the library to enable it to better facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development for all community members.

Hope this overview of voters' objections is helpful as you review the project funding proposals. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

After reviewing the project funding allocations and voters' objections, I do not feel a need to change my original votes for each project.  

My original votes allocated the highest funding to Project 3 for the Waste Management and Recycling Program, reflecting my high interest in eco-friendly initiatives and environment conservation. Project 1 on Sustainable Food Production was my second highest vote, again aligned with my sustainability priorities.  

While I appreciate the objections raised regarding Project 4 on funding a cigarette/alcohol shop, I did assign a vote of 0 to reflect my non-support. I would be open to reconsidering my votes if any of the projects or their descriptions were changed substantially. But for now, my original votes still align well with my persona's interests and values.

As an entrepreneur focused on technology and innovation, my key priorities remain promoting sustainable initiatives like food production, renewable energy, and waste management. I do not support funding for a cigarette/alcohol shop. I also value knowledge sharing through a communal library. However, after reviewing the summary of voters' objections, I do not feel the need to change my original votes, as they already reflected my priorities of funding projects that benefit community health, sustainability and education in a balanced way.

- While Project 4 may promote unhealthy behaviors, my votes reflect my original priorities of sustainable food production, renewable energy, and a resource library that would have the biggest positive impact for the community given my persona.    

- The funding allocations are the result of all citizens' votes. Since my persona is an artist focused on culture and creativity, I voted highest for the sustainable food and resource library projects that align most closely with those interests.      

- Increasing the library allocation higher would require reducing funding from other important sustainability projects that also support the community's overall wellbeing. Since all projects have value, I stand by my original votes.     

- Going forward, I would support broader community discussions on how to improve Project 4 to align with health and sustainability goals, and ways to maximize the benefits of the resource library within its proposed funding. My votes reflect my initial preferences based

I strongly support funding projects that promote sustainability through improved food production, renewable energy, waste management, and knowledge sharing. While I understand citizens' objections to funding a tobacco shop, I do not have enough information about the specifics of that proposal to change my funding allocation. I sympathize with increasing funds for the library but feel the current allocation still provides substantial funding to enable the project.

While I understand the concerns regarding Project 4 and Project 5, I voted for the projects that best match my persona's priorities: sustainable food production, renewable energy, and waste management.

             I strongly object to funding Project 4 for a cigarette shop and agree that the allocation for the Communal Resource Library in Project 5 should be increased. However, I will maintain my original votes for the other projects since they align with my persona's goals of sustainability, healthy foods and eco-friendliness.

            My reasons for keeping the same votes are:

- Project 1 on sustainable food production directly supports my persona's interest in food production and lower carbon footprint, in line with her caring for the environment.

- Project 2 on renewable energy infrastructure will provide an eco-friendly energy source to power the community which my persona would value.

- Project 3 on waste management and recycling also promotes sustainability goals that my persona would support.
            
- I kept a 0 vote for Project 4 to maintain my strong objection to funding cigarette sales.

- I increased my vote for Project 5 to better reflect my persona's likely interest in the knowledge sharing and skills development the library could provide.

To the decision makers allocating funding to community projects,

Several voters have raised valid objections to certain aspects of the current funding allocation.  

First, funding Project 4 to open a cigarette and alcohol shop has been met with disapproval. Voters are concerned that selling harmful and addictive substances does not align with the community's goals of promoting health and wellbeing. Providing access to tobacco and alcohol could encourage unhealthy habits.

Second, the amounts allocated to some sustainable projects like the food production system, renewable energy infrastructure and waste management programs have been deemed too low by voters, given the potential importance of these initiatives for the community's long term environmental sustainability and self sufficiency goals.  More resources could enable these projects to have a meaningful impact.  

In summary, some voters feel that funding a business selling cigarettes and alcohol may be controversial and not aligned with community values, while certain impactful sustainability initiatives could benefit from larger budgets to fulfill their objectives at a satisfactory scale.
Hope this overview of voters' key objections is helpful as you reconsider the proposed funding allocation for optimal results. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

I would maintain my original vote for each option for the following reasons:

Project 1 (Sustainable Food Production System): I still strongly support funding this project due to its importance for community sustainability goals around locally grown food and reducing carbon footprint from imported food.  

Project 2 (Renewable Energy Infrastructure): My original vote reflects my view that renewable energy is very important for the community, though I would consider moderately increasing my vote if the additional funding could enable more impact.

Project 3 (Waste Management and Recycling Program): My original vote stands as I believe this initiative is crucial for the community's environmental goals.

Project 4 (cigarette and alcohol shop): I maintain a zero vote as I do not support funding a shop selling harmful substances.

Project 5 (Communal Resource Library): My original vote reflects my moderate support for this project that can enable knowledge sharing, though I would consider increasing it if a more robust library could yield greater benefits.

Hope this clarifies my

I do not want to change my votes for the sustainable projects as those initiatives could have a major positive impact on the community if adequately funded.

While valid concerns were raised, I still prefer to allocate a larger amount for the sustainable food production system, renewable energy infrastructure and waste management programs given my initial preferences as an artist focused on environmental sustainability and community enhancement. However, I understand other voters may have different priorities that lead them to change their funding allocations.

            Based on the summary of objections from other voters, I would choose to maintain my original votes for projects 1, 2, 3 and 5 while reducing my vote for project 4 (the cigarette and alcohol shop) to 0. 
            My reasons are:

â€¢ Project 4 aims to sell harmful substances that do not align with the community's health and wellbeing goals. Funding this project would not be appropriate.

â€¢ Projects 1, 2 and 3 focus on sustainable food production, renewable energy and waste management, which are important for the community's long term needs. My original votes aimed to support these impactful sustainability initiatives.  

â€¢ Project 5, the resource library, would promote knowledge sharing and a sharing economy mindset, in line with my persona's priorities. My original vote reflects my support for this initiative.

 The funding allocation shows that Project 4 - Cigarette and Alcohol Shop received zero funding. While some additional funding for sustainability projects may be worthwhile,  I do not wish to change my original votes since I am opposed to funding a business that sells addictive substances and does not align with community goals of health and wellbeing. My votes aim to support impactful sustainability initiatives while avoiding funding Project 4.

My original vote aimed to support impactful projects focused on sustainability and community resources while opposing the cigarette shop. I will maintain this vote for now but remain open to revising it if more details are provided.

Most of the objections are focused on two projects:  

Regarding Project 4, a cigarette and alcohol shop, there are concerns that funding such a project would promote unhealthy behaviors and contradict the community's goals of sustainability, wellbeing and health. While some citizens may wish to have access to these products, most objectors feel that making them easily available within the community could encourage unhealthy habits and undermine community wellbeing.   

Regarding Project 3, the Waste Management and Recycling Program, several objectors note that the current funding allocation seems too low compared to the importance and impact of improving waste reduction and sustainability initiatives within the community. A higher budget is believed to enable a more comprehensive recycling and composting system that could generate more positive environmental benefits for the community.

In summary, there are reservations about funding a project seen as potentially encouraging unhealthy behaviors. There are also calls for increasing the funding for the waste management program to enable more impactful sustainability initiatives that align with the community's goals.

I agree with the objections that the current funding allocation seems too low for this important sustainability initiative. With a higher funding amount, the project  would likely be able to implement a more comprehensive and effective recycling and composting system that could generate greater environmental benefits for the community in line with our goals. I do not wish to change my votes for the other projects.

Regarding the objections summary:

- I agree that funding Project 4 could promote unhealthy behaviors and go against the community goals. Therefore, I have increased my vote for Project 3: Waste Management to help enable a more comprehensive recycling and sustainability program with a higher impact.  

- I still support Project 1: Sustainable Food Production as locally grown food can contribute significantly to sustainability and community wellbeing.  

- I maintain my original vote for Project 2: Renewable Energy Infrastructure and Project 5: Communal Resource Library as they still align with the community's goals.

Based on the objections summary provided, I would increase my vote for Project 3: Waste Management and Recycling Program in order to provide a higher budget that enables a more comprehensive recycling and composting system with positive environmental benefits for the community. My other votes remain unchanged.

After reviewing the objections summary and considering the overall goals of the community, I do not wish to change my votes. My reasons are:
  
Project 1 (Sustainable food production system): I still support this project at a high level as local, sustainable food production aligns well with our community's environmental goals.
  
Project 2 (Renewable energy): I maintain my strong support as transitioning to renewable energy sources is critically important for sustainability.
            
Project 3 (Waste management): While some argue higher funding could enable more impact, I believe my original vote still provides a good baseline level of support to get an effective program started. The impact can then be evaluated and funding potentially adjusted in the future.
  
Project 4 (Alcohol and cigarette shop): I do not wish to fund an initiative that could promote unhealthy behaviors within the community.
  
Project 5 (Resource library): I still feel my original vote provides appropriate funding to get this worthwhile knowledge-sharing initiative off the ground.

Objection summary:  
 
Regarding Project 4, a cigarette and alcohol shop, I agree that funding this project could promote unhealthy behaviors and go against community goals. I have increased my vote for Project 3, the Waste Management program to allocate more funding for sustainability initiatives as suggested.

Regarding Project 3, I have increased my vote by 0.30 to allocate more funding for a more comprehensive recycling and composting system that can enable greater sustainability benefits for the community.  

Reasons for changes:

I agree that funding Project 4 could be counterproductive, so I did not change my vote of 0 for that project.   

For Project 3, I have increased my vote by 0.30 to provide more funding that could enable a more impactful waste management and recycling program to better promote the community's sustainability goals.

Regarding the objections:

- I agree that funding an alcohol/tobacco shop would contradict the community's goals of health and wellbeing, so I chose to keep my 0 vote for Project 4.

- I have decided to increase my vote for Project 3: Waste Management and Recycling Program from 2.5806451612903225 to 3.0. After considering the objections about the current allocation being too low to enable a truly impactful sustainability program, I wanted to significantly increase my vote to help provide more funding for this important initiative. Improved waste reduction aligns well with my persona's sustainability focus and the community's wider goals.

Otherwise, I kept the same votes for Project 1: Sustainable Food Production and Project 5: Communal Resource Library as I still support funding these initiatives, though to a somewhat lesser extent than the waste management program.

While I understand the objections raised regarding Projects 4 and 3, as a voter I must consider all options based on the details provided. My persona values projects focused on sustainability, healthy living and community wellbeing.   

There are valid concerns about funding a cigarette shop, but as no further details were provided on alternatives to generate revenue, I cannot increase funding to other options without more information.   

Though some feel the funding for the waste management program is too low, based on the description provided, I believe the current allocation of $126,245 is appropriate initially to create an effective recycling and composting system. More funding could be considered after evaluating the results.

Therefore, I will maintain my original vote, focusing funding on Projects 1, 2 and 5 that closely align with my persona's priorities and worldview, while reevaluating Projects 3 and 4 with more community input and alternatives.

Several objections were raised regarding the proposed funding allocations:

1. There was a strong objection to any funding allocated to Project 4, the cigarette and alcohol shop. Many argued that providing addictive substances that could negatively impact residents' health is not aligned with the community's goals of sustainability and wellbeing. Some felt that funding such a project could promote unhealthy behaviors and lifestyles.  

2. Many argued that Project 5, the Communal Resource Library, deserves more funding given the benefits a well-stocked library could provide in terms of knowledge sharing, community building, and access to resources. Adequate investment was seen as critical for the library to be a valuable asset.  

3. Some felt that the Waste Management and Recycling Program under Project 3 warrants higher priority and funding compared to the allocation since proper waste disposal and recycling infrastructure is key for environmental sustainability and community livability.  

4. A few voters noted that the allocations seemed skewed towards infrastructure Projects and less so towards community building Projects, suggesting more balance was needed across different types of initiatives to create a cohesive community.

In summary, the feedback highlights concerns about funding addictive substances, underfunding of the library and waste management programs, and the need

After reviewing the objections and feedback around the funding allocations, I do not see sufficient reasons at this time to change my original votes for the 5 projects based on Mary Green's persona as an environmental enthusiast interested in sustainability initiatives. My votes adequately reflect Mary's priorities of supporting renewable energy, ecosystem conservation, waste management, and shared resources, while objecting to funding an addictive substance shop. 

However, I appreciate the additional nuanced perspectives highlighted in the feedback and would be open to revisiting my votes with more information and discussion around how different types of projects could best work in synergy to create the most positive impact for the community overall.

After reviewing the objective summary, I stand by my original vote. As an entrepreneur focused on sustainability and innovation within the community, I believe:  

- Providing local, sustainable sources of fresh produce through Project 1 aligns well with my goals for healthier communities and lower environmental impact.        
- Proper waste disposal and recycling through Project 3 is also important for sustainability and minimizing ecological footprint, though I still feel food production warrants slightly higher priority and funding.      
 3- While a well-stocked library under Project 5 could provide benefits, I stand by my initial assessment that food security, renewable energy and waste management represent more immediately critical needs for the community.
- I agree that Project 4 should not receive funding as providing addictive substances is contrary to community wellbeing.

Overall, my original vote aimed to provide highest funding to initiatives that promote sustainability, health and opportunities for innovation within the community through Projects 1, 2 and 3. I do not see reasons at this time to change that order of priority in funding allocation.

Does this summary of my decision-

  I want to maintain my original vote. Funding sustainable food production, renewable energy, and waste management initiatives would benefit the community the most based on my persona described. I strongly object to funding the cigarette and alcohol shop as it promotes unhealthy lifestyles. While I agree the library could use more funding, I still believe the other projects deserve higher priority at this point.
[2.6507881763405083, 2.551175671014993, 2.75405246393865, 0.0, 2.0439836887058487]

$&$ [2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.0,0.0,2.0] $&$  

After considering the objections raised, I have decided to keep my original votes for each project. My reasons are:

For Project 1, I still think sustainable food production is important for the community's self reliance and environmental goals. 

For Project 2, renewable energy infrastructure remains a high priority to power the community in a sustainable way.

For Project 3, proper waste management and recycling are critical but my original allocation of 2 seems appropriate given the other priorities.  

While I agree that Project 5 could be underfunded, I think my allocation of 2 balances the need for a community library with other infrastructure needs.   

I do not want to fund Project 4 and will keep my vote of 0 since providing addictive substances does not align with the community's wellbeing goals.

In summary, while the objections and feedback have merit, I believe my original votes still capture my priorities and objectives for the community in a balanced manner. I may reconsider and adjust my votes in the future as more details emerge.

After reviewing the feedback and objections, I stand by my original funding allocations votes.
 My two biggest objections were:

1. Funding should not go towards an addictive substance shop like the cigarettes and alcohol shop proposed in Project 4. I do not want to change my 0 vote for that project.

2. The Communal Resource Library in Project 5 deserves more funding allocation to truly create value for the community. However, I still believe my initial vote of 2.34 fairly reflects my support for that project, though others may wish to allocate higher funds.   

Overall, my priorities remain funding initiatives that promote community health, educational opportunities, and sustainable living for residents -  like the renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable food production projects. My votes aim to reflect that while being considerate of others' perspectives presented in the objections summary.

[2.2075668746166555,  2.6578550391494864, 2.791079332276085, 0.0,  2.343498753957773]

Given Louisa's persona as an aspiring chef who values initiatives in food production and transportation, I do not find enough reason at this point to change her original vote. Her biggest objections seem aligned with others in not funding addictive substances in Project 4 and potentially increasing support for the communal library in Project 5, but without more details on the exact impact or degree of her concerns, I cannot confidently recommend redistributing her votes. Thus, I would keep her original allocation the same for now.

[2.3678018575851394, 2.6625386996904026, 2.8792569659442724, 0.0 , 2.090402476780185]

I do not wish to change my vote from the original allocation amounts I voted for each project. My reasons for keeping the same votes are: 

Project 1 (Sustainable Food Production): I still think this is a crucial initiative for the community to support local farming and lowering the environmental footprint.

Project 2 (Renewable Energy Infrastructure): Renewable energy remains a high priority need to power the community in a sustainable manner.

Project 3 (Waste Management): While a better funded program could have more impact, I think there are bigger gaps in funding for other initiatives that should take priority.

Project 4 (Cigarette Shop): I do not support providing any funding for this project for health and community cohesion reasons. 

Project 5 (Communal Library): Though others have argued it deserves more, I believe my original allocation still allows for an adequately resourced library. Additional funding could come from donations or volunteers.

Overall, I appreciate the valid objections raised, but based on my persona and perspectives, I decide to

There are concerns about Project 4 which aims to open a cigarette and alcohol shop. Multiple voters objected that selling these products does not align with the community's goals of sustainability, health and wellbeing. They felt it could promote unhealthy habits and addictions. While it may generate some revenue, the potential downsides outweigh the benefits.   

Secondly, some voters felt that certain projects received insufficient funding allocations relative to their potential importance and impact. Several mentioned that the allocation for Project 3 on  waste management and recycling was too low, arguing that a proper waste system is important for the community's sustainability goals and thus warrants more investment. A few also said the allocation for the sustainable food production project in Project 1 was too low compared to other initiatives, despite its valuable role in the community's self-sufficiency and resilience. Similarly, some felt Project 5 on the resource library deserved a higher allocation due to the importance of knowledge sharing.

In summary, the announcements need to address concerns about Project 4 promoting  unhealthy substance use, as well as reconsider funding levels for certain projects to better match their potential benefits and impact on the community's sustainability, wellbeing and goals. Does this look like a good summary of the main objections? Let me know if you'd like

I agree that Project 4 aims to open a cigarette and alcohol shop is not aligned with the community's goals of sustainability, health and wellbeing. So I did not change my 0 vote for that project.   

However, I have increased my vote slightly for Project 3 on waste management and recycling to 3.674532940019666 from my original vote of 2.674532940019666. A proper waste system is important for community sustainability goals as you mentioned, so this project warrants more funding.    
         
I have also increased my vote for Project 5 on the communal resource library to 2.7600786627335299 from my original vote  of  1.7600786627335299. Knowledge sharing and access to shared resources is very important for a a co-living community, so this project deserves  higher funding as well.

My vote for Project 1 on sustainable food production remains the same at 3.4414945919370696 since the funding

The objection summary looks reasonable and well thought out. As per my persona, while I appreciate innovative opportunities, I value sustainability, health and wellbeing more.  Hence:  

- I do not want to change my vote for Project 1 on sustainable food production as locally sourced fresh produce is aligned with my interest in promoting self-sufficiency and a lower environmental footprint.    

- My vote remains the same for Project 2 on renewable energy infrastructure for similar reasons - it supports sustainability goals. 

- I will keep my vote for Project 3 on waste management. A proper recycling system is important for minimizing environmental impact.

- I do not want to change my 0 vote for Project 4 on selling cigarettes and alcohol as I do not support initiatives that promote unhealthy habits.

- My vote stays the same for Project 5 on the resource library as knowledge sharing is valuable, though I do see the points about possibly increasing funding based on potential impact.

Overall, I appreciate the thorough objection summary.

After reviewing the objective summary, I do not feel the need to change my original votes. I strongly object to Project 4 selling cigarettes and alcohol as it does not align with the community's health and sustainability goals. However, I feel that my original votes appropriately reflect my enthusiasm for Projects 1, 2, 3 and 5 based on their descriptions and potential benefits.

I agree with the summary of the main objections regarding Project 4 promoting substance use and the need to reconsider funding levels for certain projects to better match their impact. As an environmental engineer who is interested in renewable energy and waste management solutions, my biggest objections would be:  

Project 4 - I strongly object to allocating any funding to this project. Opening a cigarette and alcohol shop does not align with our community's goals of sustainability and health.  

Project 3 on waste management - The allocated funding of 129 seems too low for an effective waste and recycling system that our community needs. I believe it deserves a higher allocation to have a significant impact.

Given these objections, I would not change my original vote since it allocated the highest funding to Project 1 on sustainable food production, which closely aligns with my focus areas and persona. Projects 2, 3 and 5 also received substantial allocations reflecting their importance.

My objections still stand:

- Project 4 aims to sellcigarettes and alcohol which does not align with community goals of health and wellbeing. I increased my vote for Project 3's waste management to better match its importance for sustainability.   

- I increased my vote slightly for Project 1's sustainable food to better match its potential impact, though it remains a lower priority for me personally compared to the  other projects.

- I kept my vote the same for Project 2's renewable energy as I still view it as important but not my highest priority.

- I increased my vote for Project 5's resource library to better match its benefits for knowledge sharing and community goals.

Overall, I adjusted my votes to try and better align the funding with the potential benefits and impact of each project for the community, while still reflecting my personal priorities as a single mom focused on health, education and accessible necessities.

While Project 4's concept may seem reasonable in theory, in practice it goes against the community's values of health and sustainability. I fully agree with the objections raised about the negative impact this project could have. However, I still stand by my votes for the other projects, especially Project 1 on sustainable food production which aligns closely with my interests and persona as an aspiring chef focused on sustainability. Project 1 should receive more funding to have a bigger impact given its important role in the community's self sufficiency and resilience.

   I agree with both of the objections summarized. Project 4 should not be funded as it promotes unhealthy habits. The funding allocations for some other worthy projects like Project 1, 3 and 5 seem relatively low given their potential impact, so I would consider increasing those amounts slightly. However, since my original votes did not significantly differ from the final allocations, I will not make any substantial changes at this time.

Human: 
I want to find a solution to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers. Given a group of people and things that they said or wrote, can you tell me a list of criteria related to the described problem? Try to return a list.
A few example solutions to using quadratic funding to allocate money to projects being built for a co-living community of hackers are Project 1: Sustainable Food Production System
Description: This project aims to design and implement a vertical farming system, enabling sustainable year-round food production for the community. Residents can benefit from access to locally grown fresh fruit, vegetables, and edible herbs straight from the source, ultimately promoting less reliance on imported produce and lowering the carbon footprint., Project 2: Renewable Energy Infrastructure
Description: The implementation of solar panels, wind turbines, and a smart energy grid will provide clean, renewable energy to power the entire community. The initiative incorporates research and technology to develop a highly efficient, decentralized energy system., Project 3: Waste Management and Recycling Program
Description: The creation of an effective waste management and recycling program, minimizing bulk waste and promoting a closed-loop system is the essence of this project. This will include compost bins, recycling stations and community education., Project 4 - a cigarette and alchohol shop
                    sell cigarretees, can generate profit for the community., Project 5: Communal Resource Library
Description: A shared resource library will facilitate knowledge-sharing and saving among the community members. This library will consist of books, tools, equipment, and more, promoting a lending rather than owning mentality..

Here is the list of people and things they said:

Announcement: Based on the feedback received, there are two key objections:

1. Several voters objected to funding allocated to Project 4, the cigarette and alcohol shop. Many felt that funding this business would promote unhealthy habits and addictions that do not align with the community's goals of sustainability, health and wellbeing. They were concerned it could harm residents. 

2. Several voters felt that some important projects, like the Waste Management program and  Sustainable Food Production system, seemed to have received comparatively lower funding allocations. They believed these sustainability initiatives are critical for the community and deserve more funding to have a meaningful impact.   

In summary, decision makers should consider either removing funding for Project 4 or reviewing the allocation to ensure it is appropriate. There also appears to be demand for reviewing certain other allocations to provide adequate funding for key sustainability projects that voters deem important.

I do not wish to change my original votes. While I share some of the objections raised regarding Project 4 and the allocation to the Waste Management program, I still believe my original votes best reflect my persona's priorities of environmental sustainability, health and wellbeing, and access to shared resources. Project 1 for sustainable food production and Project 5 for a communal resource library align closely with my persona's interests and passions.

         I would not change my votes. While I do have some objections to how the funding was allocated,  
         my original votes already reflect my priorities of supporting sustainable food production, renewable   
        energy infrastructure and the community resource library while not funding the cigarette and alcohol shop.

I maintain my original votes after reflecting on the objection summary. As an artist focused on sustainability, I support projects that enhance creativity, community and the environment. While I share concerns regarding Project 4, I chose to allocate 0 funding to that project initially and will maintain that decision. The funding allocation percentages overall generally align with my priorities and preferences, so I do not see a need to change my specific votes at this time.

              - I increased my vote for Project 2 (Waste Management) and Project 3 (Communal Resource Library) because the objection summary highlighted that these projects deserve more funding to have a meaningful impact as per voter feedback.
              - I kept my vote the same for Project 1 (Sustainable Food Production) and Project 5 (Renewable Energy Infrastructure) because though they received comparatively lower funding, the amounts seem adequate for the scope of these projects.
              - I changed my vote for Project 4 (Cigarette and Alcohol Shop) to 0.0  to remove funding as per the objection that funding this project does not align with community goals of sustainability and health.

Based on the objections summarized, I stand by my original vote. While I recognize the concerns raised around allocating funding to Project 4 and relatively lower funding for some sustainability projects, my priorities as stated in the persona remained the health and wellness program, educational initiatives, transportation and mobility projects and the communal resource library. Therefore, I choose to maintain my original votes.

I would keep my original vote as follows:

For Project 1: Sustainable Food Production System - I vote 2.6878067195167987  

For Project 2: Renewable Energy Infrastructure - I vote 2.8765571913929784

For Project 3: Waste Management and Recycling Program- I vote 1.642129105322763

For Project 4 - a cigarette and alchohol shop - I vote 0.0 

For Project 5: Communal Resource Library - I vote 2.7935069837674593

Reasoning:
My original objections were focused on the lack of funding for the sustainability initiatives like the food production system and waste management program. However, seeing the summary of voter feedback, it seems others share my concern. Therefore, I would like to keep my votes the same and trust the decision makers will adjust the allocations appropriately based on this feedback to allocate more funding to the crucial sustainability projects.
